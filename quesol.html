            <h1>Welcome to Collaborative Learning</h1><br><br><br>
        <pre>
            Collaborative eLearning is an educational approach where online learning is conducted with two or more students. Unlike the old distance 
            education-inspired model of individual students getting individual feedback from instructors, collaborative eLearning is geared more towards
            the kind of interactions that happen in a physical classroom. Think of activities such as pair work, team projects, and discussion groups.

            There are a number of benefits of collaborative learning, including improved retention, reduced anxiety, and bolstered motivation.
            Collaborative learning, online or otherwise, has also been linked to the development of soft skills, a better understanding of diversity,
            and an increase in students' ownership of, and investment in, their education.
            
            Of course, collaborative eLearning has a range of applications beyond educational institutions. Coaching, training, and onboarding are 
            vital components of any successful workplace, and businesses are increasingly taking these activities online. Learning remotely with 
            colleagues brings greater flexibility and reduced stress.

            Unfortunately, most eLearning tools are still based around the distance education model of one-to-one instruction rather than Elliott Masie's
            more engaging, collaborative ideal. Although LMS platforms present themselves as digital classrooms, many simply replicate the bare bones of 
            a classroom - a whiteboard, a repository of course content, a place to submit assignments - without any thought for what's missing.
